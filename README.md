# Alesis
Code for Alesis QS6 control via SysEx commands from Python using [mido](http://mido.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

Currently in development with an ipython notebook that demonstrates raw SysEx forming in order to change some envelope parameters. 
Ultimately, control over other parameters will be added.
